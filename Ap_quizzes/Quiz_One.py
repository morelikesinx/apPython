# 1. In your on words, describe what a variable is.
 "A variable is a letter or symbol of text that is changable depending on the situation." 
# 2. Name three (3) operators we've learned about in class and describe
"Addition (+) is when you combine two numbers. creating a new bigger number, subtraction(-) is when you negatively compare two values. 
"One value is subtracted into the other, leading to a smaller number. Multiplication(*) is when you multiply a number by another value. Example: 3x3 = 9 " 
# a situation where you would use each one. 
"I would use addition is when setting a table. You need two pieces of the table to make a bigger table."
"I would use subtraction when using a motorcycle. I need to remove the damaged tire, therefore I am subtracting the two wheels by one."
"I would use multiplication when finding the solution in an algebraic expression (It tells me that the variable is 4 times greater than the present given number."
# 3. Describe the difference between camal case and pascal case.
"A camal case is when every word starts with a capital letter after the second word of a variable name"
"A Pascal case is when every word, including the first word, starts with a capital letter."
# 4. Which operator is being used in the example below
"The operator that is used is a variable"
numberOfApples = 10
numberOfOranges = 12

numberOfApples < numberOfOranges

# 5. You have been given a $100.00 dollar gift card from a family member. Another 
# family member adds 50.00 dollars to your gift card and a friend gives you $35.50. 
# Your task is to create variables for each gift amount and a final variable that
# represents the total amount of money on your gift card. 
original_gift_card = 100 
family_member = + 50
friend = + 35.50
total_amount = 185.50
# 6. Create a variable that uses the input function and then print that variable. Your variable 
# should ask a user to enter their name.  
name = input("What is your name?")

print("My name is" + name)
# 7. You have been asked to create a program for a community center that wants to plan a cookout. 
# The community center wants you to build a form program and capture several key data points. 
# They want to know a visitor's full name, their age, if they have an allergy, and what their 
# favorite food is. You need to create the appropriate varialbes with the appropriate data type
# and use the input() function and print function to take in and print out the user's responses. 
name = input("What is your name?")
print("My name is" + name)
age = input("What is your age?")
print("I am" + age)
allergy = input("What is your allergy")
print("my allergy is" + allergy)
food = input("What is you favorite food?")
print("my favorite food is" + food) 

# 8. You have been given a job to create a program for a sandwich shop. The sandwich shop
# wants to be able to know if a user has a gluten allegery before they make the sandwich order.
# If the user DOES have a glutten allergy, they need to eat a special type of bread, if the user DOES NOT
# have an allergy they can eat the regular bread. What data type would best be used in this 
# scenario and how would you write a variable to represent this value?
"A good data type is Boolean. You can use it to write 'true or false' values to answer the allergy questions."
# 9. In your own words, describe what a program is?
"A program is a certain related system that is encoded to guide people using specific topics. Programs can include websites, or online articles."
# 10. Describe the difference between a float and an integer. 
"A float is a decimal number, while an integer is a whole number with no decimal."
