1. Describe what your program is about. What problem is it trying to solve?

My program is a free and open-source tool, meant for making animations, and coding 3D rendering easy and simple. This program contains various methods and ideals to help you create visually stunning projects without stressing. My program is trying to solve the problem of misunderstanding 3D rendering. Some people can be educated on rendering, but become stressed because it is hard to understand. Sometimes, the complexity of 3D rendering can be overwhelming to the eye.

2. What three things is my program going to do?

A. My program will provide programmers with simple instructions on how to analyze rendering.
B. My program will use said intructions to guide people through each rendering process.
C. My program will give the person recommendations and references towards other examples to provide them with an idea.

3. Are there any programs that exist that does something similar to your program?

Yes. These programs include other rendering tools such as Blender, Unity, and Keyshot. All three of these apps are general purpose used to rendering UI interfaces, Icons, and potential animations.

4. What is your project MVP (minimum viable product)? What is the most basic peices of code you need to write to get your projected started and working? 

My Minimum Viable Product is the Sandbox. This would be the base of the rendering tool, so that people can script and export their vectors into the arena to start off from there.
