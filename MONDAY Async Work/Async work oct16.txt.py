WHAT IS  MLA STYLE CITATION?
MLA stands for Modern Language Association. As you go further in your academic, 
and potentially professional career you'll need to conduct research and reference 
where you got your information. 
This is done for a variety of reasons, such as:
- allows your reader to see where you got your information from.
- gives credit to the people and organizations that have done the research.
- protects the writer from claims of plagarizing their work. 

MLA is written as followed:
full name of the author, title of article/ video, date article was published, 
website link for article/video

Example:
John Doe, "Article about code", the coding newspaper, 10 October, 2023.
