# A computer program is a block of code used as a set of instructions for the computer to do something.

# Three data types include: an integer, boolean, and string.
# 1. I would use an integer when I would want to input a whole number into a block of code.
# 2. I would use a boolean when using a conditional function to determine of something is true or false
# 3. I would use a string if I would want to make a list for a function

# We use the input function to input a user's data

# Strings 
name = "Jordan"
school = "Boys Latin"

# Booleans
IsTrue = False
IsFalse = True

# Integers

# floats

# Lists
