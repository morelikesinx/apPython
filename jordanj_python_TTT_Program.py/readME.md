# Project Review

1. <b>What inspired you (or your team) to develop this program?</b>
I was inspired to develop this program by seeing other tic tac toe programs being put into real games. Both online and actual boardgames.

2. <b>What was a road block that you had with writing your program? How did you solve your  problem?</b>
There were a few road blocks that came up during the development of this program. They were certain syntax problems halfway through the code that left me blocked for a few hours. The two other problems with issues with the positioning of X and O on the board, and the grid itself being uneven.

3. <b>What is somthing you would have liked to have added or done differently?</b>
If I had more time, I would have tried to re-configure the code into being played by the computer, therefore the player gets more of a challenge.
